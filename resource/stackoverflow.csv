Research Tree/Graph Depth in Google Docs,"I'm working on a research tree in Google Docs, and I had the idea to include a research tree Depth cell next to each research to make it easier to see which researches require more or fewer parents so there won't be five research projects at one stage and only one in the next stages.The graph's structure (I found out through browsing wikipedia that this is not a tree because some nodes split into routes which later on combine again) looks like this:Not pictured: ""Name group"" column, which contains the research name without numerals. Also not pictured is the period after each research name to make the children code work.With C. being the amount of Children this research has:And P. being the amount of Parents the research has:With these functions, the information I have is:And another useful fact about the situation:I'm not sure if there's an easy way to implement Graph traversal in this situation to come up with the research tree depth I want, and I'd really just like some kind of indication as to how ""advanced"" some research is.

"Setting width and margin to auto on inner div, CSS, HTML [duplicate]","I have 2 divs. One inside of another. The one on the outside has a width and height of 500px, and the one on the inside have a width of auto. I'm trying to center the div on the inside, but I'm also trying to get the width of it to be auto. It's not adjusting the width to auto, and instead it's spanning the entire 500px of the outer div. I'm not sure what I did wrong, so please take a look at my code: if you use padding in #outer you can do what you wantsee snippet:

#outer {
  border: 1px solid black;
  width: 500px;
  height: 500px;
  margin:auto; /* demo purposes */
  padding:5%
}
#inner {
  border: 1px solid black;
  width: auto;
  padding:2%; /* demo purposes */
  background:red;  /* demo purposes */
}
<div id='outer'>
  <div id='inner'>Inner</div>
</div>


Try this: Demo here.Div's are display: block which defaults to filling the entire width of the parent.  So when you are setting it to width: auto it's doing the default.  If you want to make it conform to it's content, then set it to display: inline-block.  Since inline-block can be centered like text just add text-align: center to your #outer div.  Like so:

#outer {
  border: 1px solid black;
  width: 500px;
  height: 500px;
  text-align: center;
}
#inner {
  border: 1px solid black;
  display: inline-block;

Port 25 works when exe run manually but blocked when run as service,"I am installing a program for a client which sends outgoing mail only using SMTP on port 25.

We are coordinating with their tech support to see if they can find out why their mail server is behaving this way, but are not sure if they'll find anything as it seems like an obscure error.Does anyone know why the port would allow a connection from the executable when run manually, but not when the executable is run as a service under the same user?This is the error message the service is showing:I apologize for my lack of knowledge, this is not my area of expertise.

Calling CodeIgniter get_instance in Wordpress causes 404,"I've been working for the past day or so on getting Wordpress the play nicely with Codeigniter.

How to add user input to a JavaScript array,"I am in the process of learning JavaScript and jQuery, so apologies if any of this sounds naive or obvious. I started what I thought was a fairly simple project to practice and hopefully learn something in the process. What I want to do is this: the user inputs a sentence and hits a submit button. The sentence gets added to a list of other sentences submitted by people (preferably on a separate file, preferably encrypted, but not necessary). Then, the website grabs a random sentence from the list and displays it. I am not asking on how to build all of this. I have already put most of it together, but I am including it here for reference. I have a separate javascript file with the array of quotes.Then I randomly display one using this:And adding <script> getQuote(); </script> to the html.This all works fine.The part I cannot seem to figure out is taking user input and adding it to the jQuery array.

This is the last method I tried, if it helps:So, to reiterate, I want to take user input and add it to a JavaScript array. I have scoured stackoverflow and the interet but nothing has worked. Please help!should be EDIT: With a content editable div you need to use text() instead. Here is an example fiddle. https://jsfiddle.net/Problem is document.getElementsByClassName(""input"") gives you a NodeList and not just a single html element. So if you do this document.getElementsByClassName(""input"").value, you will end up quotes as [undefined, undefined ... undefined]. Assuming you have single element with the class name input, go with index 0. Also as you stated that you are using div with attribute contenteditable, you may try this instead. document.getElementsByClassName(""input"")[0].innerHTMLTry this example.

var quotes = [];

$(function() {
  $('#btn').on('click', function(e) {
    quotes.push($('#quote').html());

How to force Python dictionary to shrink?,"I have experienced that in other languages. Now I have the same problem in Python. I have a dictionary that has a lot of CRUD actions. One would assume that deleting elements from a dictionary should decrease the memory footprint of it. It's not the case. Once a dictionary grows in size (doubling usually), it never(?) releases allocated memory back. I have run this experiment:The last line of the first loop is 6291736. The last line of the second loop is 6291736 as well. And the size of the dictionary is 0. So how to tackle this issue? Is there a way to force release of memory? PS: don't really need to do random - I played with the range of the second loop.The way to do this ""rehashing"" so it uses less memory is to create a new dictionary and copy the content over.The Python dictionary implementation is explained really well in this video:https://youtu.be/C4Kc8xzcA68There is an atendee asking this same question (https://youtu.be/C4Kc8xzcA68?t=1593), and the answer given by the speaker is: ",1.437E+12,1,30,FALSE,2,/questions/31442906/how-to-force-python-dictionary-to-shrink

Postgresql searchable retail database: Single table or multiple?,"So I am working on developing a backend for an retail app and am wondering about how to organize the data.

The cost is that certain products could fall through the woodwork as these tables could function as ""ruts"". (If a product is put in the wrong table it will be impossible to find). The second system will take significantly longer to search. I realize additional degrees of abstraction will give either system some of the benefits of both...

The nearest thing you can do is 'embed' Bar in all your types (Foo included).This feature acts somewhat like a blend of inheritance and composition. While the Foo type will technically be 'composed' of a Bar type (among other fields), the methods on the Bar type are in a sense promoted so that they can be invoked directly from Foo.
